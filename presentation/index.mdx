# What is React?

<Image src={ReactLogo} width="4em" height="4em" />

<br />

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

<br />

It is the view layer for web applications.

# React Hooks

<br />

Hooks are a new addition in React **16.8**.

They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

<Cite>React Docs</Cite>

---

# Compatibility

- **Completely opt-in:** You can try Hooks in a few components without rewriting any existing code.
  But you don’t have to learn or use Hooks right now if you don’t want to.

* **100% backward-compatible:** Hooks don’t contain any breaking changes.

---

# What is a Hook?

<br />

What is a Hook? A Hook is a special function that lets you **“hook into”** React features.

<br />

For example, **useState** is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.

# Problems to solve with Hooks

- Wrapper Hell **(HOC, render prop)**

* Huge Components

- Confusing Classes (**this** keyword)

---

# When Would I use a Hook?

- If you have a function component and you need to add some **state** to it.

* Local state management when using Global Store **Ex: Redux**

- **LifeCycle** methods on your Function components

---

# When to avoid using a Hook?

- Only Call Hooks at the **Top Level**

* Don't Call Hooks inside **loops**, **conditions**, or **nested functions**.

- Only use Hooks on Function Component

# LifeCycle Hooks **(Effect)**

The Effect Hook let you perform **side effects** in function components.

<br />

like using **componentWillMount**, **ComponentDidMount...** or any other LifeCycle Method on a class Component

<Notes>
  Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in
  React components are all examples of side effects. Whether or not you’re used
  to calling these operations “side effects” (or just “effects”), you’ve likely
  performed them in your components before.
</Notes>

# The Concept Behind useEffect

<br />

`useEffect` works the same as **componentDidMount** & **componentDidUpdate**

which you can use to do some stuff after or before state update

<br />

You can also use it to do some cleanup like **componentWillUnmount**

# Custom Hooks

Custom Hooks allows you to re-use hook logic and share it among components.

Hooks always need to start with **use** as a naming convention

---

# So, Why Hooks?

<br />

Hooks makes it simpler to create lightweight embeddable components across your **React App.**

- Manage State/SideEffects without the need for writing a class.

* Build custom hooks for your own state management.

- Readable code & easier to maintain components (smaller).
